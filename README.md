# ✿ SLOWSYNCED  

**i create beautiful worlds that feel like memories you never had**

> a quiet archive of digital dreams, broken syntax, and beautiful accidents —  
> where pixels dream, logic hums like film static, and every line of code carries a frame of feeling.  
> lavender echoes hum through the code, and cats guard the source files.


## Upcoming Series
### _How to Not Sob When Your Code Doesn't Work_  
a tragicomedy told through existential error messages and debugging, misplaced semicolons, and hope reborn through `console.log()`

**Featuring:**  
- misplaced parentheses 
- the small spark of hope when something finally compiles  

*episode 1 drops when my brain stops melting*


## About Me

hey, i'm **z** —  

20 · cat-coded · pink panther energy · philosophical chaos

- a **poetic programmer** with a flair for cinematic melancholy  
- the human version of a curious cat wandering through code and chaos  
- a believer that even bugs can be beautiful if the lighting's right  

i wander between silent tabs of VS Code at 2AM and the soft belief that bugs are not mistakes — they're **unrealized stories** waiting for direction. 


## Skills

`uhh idk but somehow things compile??`  

- good at petting cats  
- great at crying over code aesthetically  
- average at debugging but excellent at suffering  

*(also Python, C++, JS ... but shhh that ruins the magic)*


## What You'll Find Here

- **tiny universes** written in code  
- **scripts** that feel like diary entries  
- **interfaces** that feel more like short films than software  
- **experimental projects** stitched together with intuition and insomnia  
- **fragments of poetry, film, and code** in perpetual conversation  
- **half-working things** i'm emotionally attached to  

you *may* receive: 
- a cat pun 
- a mystical snippet of code 
- a tiny tulip 
- or a lavender-scented haiku

*no promises. this realm has its own mood.*


## Philosophy  

here, code is not merely written — it's **directed**.  

every repo, a scene.   
every commit, a cut.  

i believe in the art of imperfection — the frame left unfocused, the dream half-rendered.
